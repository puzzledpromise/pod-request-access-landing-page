/* Difference between display: none and visibility: hidden? : 

display:none means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all 
(although you can still interact with it through the dom). There will be no space 
allocated for it between the other tags.

visibility:hidden means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible, but 
space is allocated for it on the page. The tag is rendered, it just isn't seen on the page.
